### GFLClan Breach
#### February 15, 2017 - February 11, 2021

This is the git repository of the GFLClan Breach server in roughly the same state as it was in prior to its shutdown on February 11, 2021. Some components were removed, mainly stuff specific to GFL or addons that we had purchased (that we are not allowed to release publicly). The code is provided as is without warranty or any promises made about its quality or functionality. GFL Staff will not help you set it up nor will we release bug fixes or accept pull requests. This code is made public under no license in particular as it would be a very difficult task to get the consent of all the authors involved, however, you are generally free to use this for whatever you like, however, we would strongly advise against using this in production due to the state of the code.
